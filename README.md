the python code for calculating the commutator of many body operator

This code primarily relies on the sympy library, so please ensure that the library is installed in your Python environment. Additionally, you will need to install the tqdm library to display progress, especially when computing commutators involving three-body operators or higher, as such calculations can become very time-consuming.

We have provided examples in the example.ipynb file, which can be run directly.
